We will be doing a rules-based simulation with the different types of objects/actors, the Predators, the Prey, and the Resources. This will include certain elements of flocking with added rules for hunting, eating, and seperation.
Max is doing Predator Class, which will have two rules for autonomous movement, seperation from other Predators and hunting Prey. The objects in this class will be represented as Lions, and contain properties and methods for movement, movement direction based on other predators, and direction based on nearest prey.
Isaiah is doing Prey Class, which will consider rules both  forfood proximity and predator proximity. They Prey class will obey two rules 1. Consume enough food to be satisfied within recent time frame 2. Avoid predators; this will be balanced with avoiding starvation. The objects in this class will be represented as Antelopes. There will be eat and movement functions in this class based on these rules.
Patrick is doing Resource Class, which will have rules for depletion and respawning. The objects in this class will be represented as grass. The resources will be user controlled. When the user clicks on a spot, a resource will appear. The rules for resources are as follows: 1. A resource will be given a set amount of "health." 2. For each frame, the health will drop one unit for every prey in the resource 3. Once the resource's health is zero or lower, the resource will be depleted, and the resource will disappear. Because of user interactivity, arrayLists will need to be used to store a variable number of objects
