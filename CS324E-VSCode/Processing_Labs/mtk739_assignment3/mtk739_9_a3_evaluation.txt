For this project, I wrote the script to extract all words, unique words, and word frequency into text files. We then used these files to construct a word cloud via Word Clouds, a student-made word cloud of a random selection of unique words done by Isaiah, and a visual representation of word frequency done by Patrick. Patrick worked on the a3_wordfrequency file. He used the word frequency to display a bar graph with the amount of words with a frequency of one at the top. As possible extra credit, he came up with the idea for an array of colors is referenced to give a rainbow effect. For novel visualization worked on by Isaiah, he chose a black background with bold colors to fit the dark theme of Frankenstein as this was the corpus we used. He implemented a search feature that makes it so any string entered restricts the displayed words in the cloud until enter/return is hit to clear the entry. He also had the idea of unique words appearing in the corpus being displayed on screen in a random one of our three colors, until a mouse click cycles out which of the currently eligible words are displayed. After each aspect was considered functional, we peer reviewed each others code including corrections, suggestions, and options for improved efficiency. This teamwork facillitated most of the more involved/bonus features and allowed us to improve each others code while improving our own. Overall, it was fun and easy experience with my team members and I highly enjoyed working with them. Everyone made an effort to be in calls on time and to be present and helpful during them. 5/5 for both of them.
