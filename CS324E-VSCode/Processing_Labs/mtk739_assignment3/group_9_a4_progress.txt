Patrick will be in charge of the cherry blossoms. These blossoms will be created using a PShape object. Parameters that the class will include will be the starting coordinates. The class will also call movement functions for each blossom. One movement will be the blossoms falling down in a curve, another will have the blossoms rotate as they fall. If time permits we would also like to include a function for the blossoms to become large as they fall, giving the illusion that they are becoming closer. A larger class will store an array of these blossoms, and continuously have them fall so that multiple blossoms are present with different starting positions. Max will be in charge of the cherry blossom tree. The tree itself will be a fixed object in the scene, but its branches with rose blossoms will be pivoting and spinning the rose blossoms. The Tree class will have a PShape group holding the tree trunk and branches PShapes, with the branches having a blossom PShape as a child. There will be only one instance of the tree class and only one tree PShape in the PShape group, however there will be multiple branch objects with different orientations and sizes, and on different movement paths. The Tree class will have a moveBranches() method that moves each branch individually, which will also trigger movement in each rose blossom. The Tree class will have an x, y, numBranches, and movementSpeed field. Isaiah will be in charge of the sun and moon. The sun and moon will be of the class celestial body, with the sun having attached rays that grow as its height in the sky increases. The sun will have its own inherited class with a constructor that adds the sun-beam objects. They move and grow as part of the suns move method. The sun and moon will ride and set with the sun beams growing as it reaches its apex in the sky. The sun and moon will share a celestial object class which will differ in color size, and beam intensity.
