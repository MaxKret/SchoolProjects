In this assignment, we used per-pixel manipulation in order to create a series of 
commonly-used filters. We also implemented basic input-handling and image buffering. 
Filters are applied to this image when the user clicks the number keys. 
Each filter was applied individually.
/*
  //default
  if(key_pressed == '0')

  //grayscale
  if(key_pressed == '1')
  
  //contrast

  //Gaussian blur
  if(key_pressed == '3')
  
  //edge detection
