For this project, Patrick handled the roof. This is accomplished through the Pyramid class. A pyramid is created with parameters being size, starting position, and ending position. The pyramid then descends from the starting position to the ending position when the drawPyramid method is called, and rotates as it descends. Isaiah oversaw the main structure of the house. This was the main cube that makes up the house, which rotates and translates across the screen into place. Overall, the largest challenge for all of us was synchronization of animations so that each fit together seamlessly in a loop. Mine was done with Linear Interpolation using the frameCount System Variable, which caused a few roblems with synchronization, but they were more than willing and ready to rework their and my parts for all of them to be on time together. Again, after each aspect was considered functional, we peer reviewed each others code including corrections, suggestions, and options for improved efficiency. This teamwork facillitated most of the more involved features and allowed us to improve each others code while improving our own. Overall, it was fun and easy experience with my team members and I highly enjoyed working with them. Everyone made an effort to be in calls on time and to be present and helpful during them. 5/5 for both of them.
