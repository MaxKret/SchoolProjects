									"Shattered," a brand new thriller directed by Luis Prieto ("White Lines"), releases in select 
									theaters, including Austin's Galaxy Highland 10, and on demand Jan. 14. Cameron Monaghan 
									("Gotham," "Shameless") stars as Chris, a young millionaire who, after selling his successful 
									tech company, enjoys the privileges of his new-found wealth in a secluded mountain home. 
									As the film progresses, Chris begins to fall for Sky (Lilly Krug), a local girl who grows 
									up close to the rich recluse. After an injury forces Chris into a wheelchair, Sky volunteers 
									to be his at-home nurse. From there, "Shattered" descends into a maddening sprial of violence 
									and deception in the style of a classic 1990s erotic thriller. The Daily Texan spoke with 
									star Cameron Monaghan about his time on the film and work as an actor.
									
									The Daily Texan: What is the collaboration between actor, director and fight coordinator like?

									Cameron Monaghan: We had a great stunt coordinator, but also Luis, our director, really knew 
									what he wanted. We had a lot of rehearsals. That being said, we were on a really accelerated 
									filming schedule. We shot this entire movie in three and a half weeks. Working on a pretty 
									small budget, I think it was really impressive and amazing how much they were able to get done 
									and how quickly and effectively they did it. It was really exciting to play a role that was 
									this physical, balls to the wall. Obviously, we were working with (Frank Grillo), who is 
									extremely experienced in stunts. He was very capable and intense in his physical movements.
